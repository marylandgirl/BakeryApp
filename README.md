## This BakeryApp project was done as a group assignment for Java Bootcamp

The developers are Zhi Cheng & Kim Levin

The requirements are below:

Create at least 15 baked goods and save it into a collection of data. Each baked good has a name, price, an expiration date, one or more diet restrictions (ie. gluten allergies), and quantity in stock. The program should allow the user to search by diet restrictions and print all matching results. For a list of example products, see https://sensitivesweets.com/collections/breads

All processes must happen in Classes, not in the main method of a Main class.
